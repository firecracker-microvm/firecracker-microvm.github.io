            Firecracker enables you to deploy workloads in lightweight virtual machines, called microVMs, which provide
            enhanced security and workload isolation over traditional VMs, while enabling the speed and resource
            efficiency of containers. Firecracker was developed at Amazon Web Services to improve the customer
            experience of services like
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>
            and
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">AWS Fargate</a>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            Firecracker is a virtual machine monitor (VMM) that uses the Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) to
            create and manage microVMs. Firecracker has a minimalist design. It excludes unnecessary devices and guest
            functionality to reduce the memory footprint and attack surface area of each microVM. This improves
            security, decreases the startup time, and increases hardware utilization. Firecracker is generally available on
            <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker#supported-platforms">
              64-bit Intel, AMD and Arm CPUs with support for hardware virtualization.

              Firecracker microVMs use KVM-based virtualizations that provide enhanced security over traditional VMs.
              This ensures that workloads from different end customers can run safely on the same machine. Firecracker
              also implements a minimal device model that excludes all non-essential functionality and reduces the
              attack surface area of the microVM.

              In addition to a minimal device model, Firecracker also accelerates kernel loading and provides a minimal
              guest kernel configuration. This enables fast startup times. Firecracker initiates user space or
              application code in as little as 125 ms and supports microVM creation rates of up to 150 microVMs per
              second per host.

              Each Firecracker microVM runs with a reduced memory overhead of less than 5 MiB, enabling a high density

              This enables optimized sharing of network and storage resources, even across thousands of microVMs.

            Firecracker runs in user space and uses the Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) to create microVMs. The
            fast startup time and low memory overhead of each microVM enables you to pack thousands of microVMs onto the
            same machine. This means that every function, container, or container group can be encapsulated with a
            virtual machine barrier, enabling workloads from different customers to run on the same machine, without any
            tradeoffs to security or efficiency. Firecracker is an
            <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/all-you-need-know-about-kvm-userspace">alternative to QEMU</a>
            , an established VMM with a general purpose and broad feature set that allows it to host a variety of guest
            operating systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can control the Firecracker process via a RESTful API that enables common actions such as configuring
            the number of vCPUs or starting the machine. It provides built-in rate limiters, which allows you to
            granularly control network and storage resources used by thousands of microVMs on the same machine. You can
            create and configure rate limiters via the Firecracker API and define flexible rate limiters that support
            bursts or specific bandwidth/operations limitations. Firecracker also provides a metadata service that
            securely shares configuration information between the host and guest operating system. You can set up and
            configure the metadata service using the Firecracker API. Each Firecracker microVM is further isolated with
            common Linux user-space security barriers by a companion program called "jailer". The jailer provides a
            second line of defense in case the virtualization barrier is ever compromised.

            <section>
              Firecracker was built by developers at Amazon Web Services to enable services such as
              <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>
              and
              <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">AWS Fargate</a>
              to improve resource utilization and customer experience, while providing the security and isolation
              required of public cloud infrastructure. Firecracker started from Chromium OS's Virtual Machine Monitor,
              <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/crosvm/">crosvm</a>
              , an open source VMM written in Rust. Today, crosvm and Firecracker have diverged to serve very different
              customer needs.

              is an open source community where we collaborate with crosvm and other groups and individuals to build and

            <section>
              When we launched Lambda in November of 2014, we were focused on providing a secure
              <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/">serverless</a>
              experience. At launch we used per-customer EC2 instances to provide strong security and isolation between
              customers. As Lambda grew, we saw the need for technology to provide a highly secure, flexible, and
              efficient runtime environment for services like Lambda and Fargate. Using our experience building isolated
              EC2 instances with hardware virtualization technology, we started an effort to build a VMM that was
              tailored to run serverless functions and integrate with container ecosystems.

              system while excluding non-essential functionality (only 5 emulated devices are available: virtio-net,
              virtio-block, virtio-vsock, serial console, and a minimal keyboard controller used only to stop the
              microVM). This, along with a streamlined kernel loading process enables a &lt; 125 ms startup time and a

              rate limiting for microVMs, and provides a microVM metadata service to enable the sharing of configuration
